# Code Class - Intro into Web Components

## Getting started
Clone repository:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:voorhoede/code-class-template.git
```

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm i
```

Start server & watch files:
```

This wil build the project, start the server and start the watcher. The project is available on localhost:3000. The watcher task wil automatically build assets, styles and views. The server will be reloaded on every change.
